\ Bug: string memory corruption in array word definitions
\
\ Define a word containing an array with strings
colors: [ { "red" "green" "blue" } ] ;

\ This intermediate operation would corrupt the strings if they were slices
"Some intermediate text here:" print

\ Access the array - strings should not be corrupted
colors .

\ Test with symbols in arrays too (same bug)
point: [ { x: y: } ] ;
"Another intermediate:" print
point .

\ Nested arrays with strings
nested: [ { { "hello" "world" } { "foo" "bar" } } ] ;
"More intermediate text:" print
nested .
